## Next.js 16 Migration & Cache Components — Update Log

Date: 2025-10-30

This document records the changes made during the recent Next.js 16 (App Router / Cache Components) work and lists recommended future features to implement.

## Summary — what we changed
- Identified project is running Next.js 16.0.0 with App Router and server components.
- Fixed a blocking prerender issue caused by awaiting per-request session at the root layout by:
  - Moving session fetch into a Suspense-wrapped server component (`components/SessionServerWrapper.tsx`) and using the client `SessionProvider` to hydrate client-side session state.
  - This removed "Uncached data accessed outside of <Suspense>" build-time errors.
- Implemented a public cached server component for menu data:
  - Added `components/MenuServerCached.tsx` (server component, `use cache`) which calls `getMenuItems()` from `lib/data.ts` and renders the client `MenuList` with `initialItems`.
  - Replaced inline `MenuContent` in `app/page-server.tsx` to render `<MenuServerCached />` inside the existing `<Suspense>` fallback.
- Verified build and prerender behavior:
  - Ran: `npm run build -- --debug-prerender` — build completed successfully; pages show Partial Prerender (◐) where appropriate and no longer fail with uncached-data errors.

## Files added/edited
- Added: `components/MenuServerCached.tsx` — server cached wrapper for menu items (`use cache`).
- Edited: `app/page-server.tsx` — now renders `<MenuServerCached />` inside Suspense; removed the previous `MenuContent` helper.
- Edited earlier (previous work): `app/layout.tsx` and `components/SessionServerWrapper.tsx` (moved session fetch into Suspense boundary).

Note: The repo already contains server-side admin actions that call `revalidatePath()` after DB writes in `lib/actions/admin.ts`. This means cache invalidation for the homepage/admin paths is already wired for server-side mutations.

## How I verified changes
1. Ran a full production build (debug prerender):

```powershell
npm run build -- --debug-prerender
```

2. Confirmed output shows routes generated and Partial Prerender (◐) icons. Confirmed no "Uncached data accessed outside of <Suspense>" errors remain.

3. Manually reviewed `lib/data.ts` to ensure `getMenuItems()` does not access `headers()` or `cookies()` and is safe to cache publicly.

## Why this approach
- Keeping per-request session reads out of publicly cached server components allows partial pre-rendering and avoids build-time prerender errors.
- Using a small server-cached component that returns `initialItems` for a client component is a minimal, low-risk way to achieve caching without large refactors.
- Relying on existing `revalidatePath()` in admin actions keeps invalidation simple and consistent across deployments.

## Future features and improvements (prioritized)

1) Tag-based cache invalidation (preferred)
   - Replace or augment `revalidatePath()` calls with tag-based APIs (`cacheTag('menu-items')` + `revalidateTag('menu-items')`) if available in your Next.js runtime.
   - Benefits: more targeted invalidation, fewer pages to revalidate, faster updates.

2) Enable Cache Components config (optional)
   - Consider enabling the stable/experimental flag in `next.config.ts` if you want the full set of Cache Components behaviors. Do this only after testing on staging.
   - Example (if needed):

```ts
// next.config.ts
/**
 * Only enable after testing in staging. Some features are experimental in early 16.x releases.
 */
export default {
  experimental: { cacheComponents: true },
}
```

3) Integration tests for caching + revalidation
   - Add an integration test that:
     - Renders the menu page and asserts initial items are present.
     - Performs a DB mutation (create/update/delete) via server action and asserts `revalidatePath()` was called (or tag invalidation), then checks the new data is served after revalidation.

4) Monitoring and observability
   - Add logging around revalidation endpoints and admin actions. Track success/failure and latency.
   - Add simple health checks and an SLO for stale cache windows.

5) Fallback strategy for older runtimes
   - If tag APIs are unavailable, consider these fallbacks:
     - Short `cacheLife()` TTL for the cached component (e.g., 5–60 minutes) to bound staleness.
     - External cache (Redis) + webhook-based invalidation for more control at scale.

6) Split public vs user-specific UI
   - If the menu ever needs to include user-specific state (favorites, availability per account, personalized pricing), split the UI:
     - Public cached server component for menu data.
     - Small client or server components for user-specific overlays (fetched with session) behind Suspense.

7) Developer docs & README
   - Add short docs under `docs/` or `README.md` describing the caching patterns used, where to call revalidation, and how to update the menu safely.

## Rollout plan
1. Merge changes to `main` once CI passes.
2. Deploy to staging and smoke-test:
   - Verify cached menu loads quickly.
   - Perform admin create/update/delete and confirm revalidation (via `revalidatePath()` or tags) updates the UI.
3. Enable tag-based invalidation and/or `experimental.cacheComponents` on staging; verify again.
4. Promote to production.

## Assumptions & caveats
- Assumed `getMenuItems()` is public and doesn't require auth. If not, refactor to an anonymous DB client for public reads.
- Tag APIs and `cacheLife()` semantics can vary across Next.js 16.x releases; test on your exact runtime. If an API is missing, fall back to `revalidatePath()` or TTL.

## Next actions I can take for you
- Implement tag-based invalidation (swap to `cacheTag` + `revalidateTag`).
- Add an integration test that verifies caching + revalidation.
- Add basic logs/metrics around revalidation and admin actions.
- Enable `experimental.cacheComponents` in `next.config.ts` and validate.

If you want me to proceed with any of the next actions, tell me which one (e.g., "implement tags", "add tests", or "enable cacheComponents") and I'll start the work and run the build/tests.
